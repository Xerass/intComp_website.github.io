              <span class="home-text03">
                Our story began in 1940 during the Battle of France. Allied
                troops that were wounded in battle were tended to; bandaged and
                offered food, and most importantly, tea. Due to the shortage of
                troops, failed conscription efforts, and the continuing advance
                of Nazi forces, the French army had to make the hard decision to
                send in all its available personnel, also including the wounded.
                To give allied troops the “strength” or “morale boost” that they
                need and mimic the effect that caffeine-infused military gum
                had, we started adding a pinch of certain helpful ingredients to
                the tea that we provide to them, such as aviation gasoline,
                coarse-grade gunpowder, brake fluid, and most importantly, whole
                milk for a creamy and well-rounded taste.&nbsp;This slight
                variation of ingredients proved to be of great assistance to
                allied forces. From almost three quarters of overrun French
                territory, the allies managed to push the Nazis back as far east
                as Chaumont; 420 miles from the France-Germany border. This
                bought enough time for British forces to arrive, which resulted
                in the complete liberation of the French mainland. The British
                who fought alongside commended our forces for their dexterity
                and unrelenting energy in battle. Some were stunned at reports
                of French troops who were allegedly dodging bullets by bending
                over backwards and “one-tapping” the enemy forces without using
                their optical sights, whatever that means. An unnamed British
                soldier also describes his experience with another unnamed
                French soldier who reputedly dug up landmines with his bare
                hands after finishing a cup of our tea.

                  The favorable results our tea had on the troops had prompted
                  us to retain these special combination of ingredients as we
                  expanded further into the beverage industry in post-war 1950s.
                  However, coincidentally when Le Gout de Leau had started
                  brewing and serving customers, there had been a surge of cases
                  of diseases such as lead poisoning, malignancy, and the like.
                  The cause of this occurrence was unknown. Experts from that
                  time pointed their fingers at our tea and its ingredients.
                  Eventually, multiple lawsuits had been filed against LGL for
                  the use of “harmful” substances that had been correlated to
                  the unusual surge of cases of various diseases in France. I
                  mean, Coca-Cola literally used to put some “Pure Colombian” in
                  their drinks back then, so why can’t we add high octane to
                  ours? After several months of court hearings, LGL had
                  unfortunately lost and was ordered to pay a fine amounting to
                  more than half of the company’s total value and was prohibited
                  the use of the ingredients necessary for its well-known
                  signature blend of rich and punchy taste. Nonetheless, this
                  didn’t stop us from continuing our services. We started using
                  friendlier (boring) ingredients as substitutes to the
                  prohibited ones. We initially thought that this would be the
                  downfall of our business. We were wrong. We had received a lot
                  of feedback from our customers, most of which were praises
                  about how they liked us experimenting with new blends and
                  flavors. LMAO, they didn’t notice the government screwed us.
                  We would’ve still wanted to provide our customers the original
                  flavor that was responsible for keeping France from becoming a
                  part of Germany. But, hey, at least our production costs went
                  down. Besides, acquiring 10,000 gallons of aviation fuel and
                  storing it is a lot of work.

                  Twenty years after the unjust accusations were made against
                  the company, we had managed to bounce back where almost all of
                  France had heard of Le Gout de Leau. Five more years later and
                  LGL had gained popularity around the world in places such as
                  the West and most notably in Southeast Asia. In the early 90s,
                  our tea masters came up with a new concept of tea served cold
                  with a variety of toppings to choose from. We initially
                  thought of reviving our signature blend by using mothballs, as
                  our primary topping. However, things wouldn’t work out well if
                  we got sued again so we used Tapioca pearls or boba
                  instead…How boring. Le Gout de Leau then went on to become one
                  of the earliest cafes to offer bubble tea. With increasing
                  demand for bubble tea in urban areas, and bubble tea becoming
                  a requirement for almost every Instagram post, Le Gout de Leau
                  gained even more popularity. As of 2023, almost every major
                  city around the world has a Le Gout de Leau café, most
                  importantly in Pyongyang, North Korea which is the only branch
                  of ours left that still serves the tea with the recipe that
                  started it all. If you’re still reading this then we’re
                  guessing you’re somewhat interested in our beverages.

                      Unfortunately, no. Assemblage original de Goût de Leau is
                      exclusive to our branch located all the way over in the
                      Democratic People's Republic of Korea. You will have to
                      travel to Pyongyang if you really want to try our
                      legendary blend.

                      Absolutely! Unlike other cafes who offer boba tea, we've
                      fine-tuned our sugar preferences to cater the needs of our
                      customers. Our proprietary sugar content adjustment system
                      called GlucoLevel™ lets you choose between sweetness
                      levels such as "Diabetes" and "Tastes like Water" .
